**Week 1 â€“ Ribbon Tabs Overview**

Documented key ribbons and tools in the following Excel tabs:-
- Home
- Insert
- Draw
- Page Layout
- Formulas

**Week 2 â€“ Data Cleaning with Kutools**

This week focused on applying Excel tools and the Kutools add-in to clean and organize data while maintaining data integrity.

Tasks Completed:
- Copied data between sheets for backup and reference
- Used **Kutools** to detect and highlight duplicates
- Selected **"All duplicates (Except 1st one)"** to preserve first occurrences
- Deleted duplicate rows while keeping the original data sheet untouched
- Maintained a cleaned version on **Sheet2**

 Tools Used:
- Microsoft Excel (Tabs: Home, Data)
- **Kutools** Add-in for advanced Excel functionality

This exercise improved my data cleaning workflow and demonstrated how to safely modify data without losing the original.

**Week 3 â€“ COUNTIF/COUNTIFS Practice:-**

Used formulas to:
- Count specific entries based on one or more conditions
- Analyze trends in a dataset
**Functions Applied:** `COUNTIF`, `COUNTIFS`
  
**Week 4 â€“ Excel Tips & Formatting**

**Key Concepts:**
- Referencing sheets safely
- Editing data without loss
- Preventing auto-date conversion (e.g., `1-5` becoming `5-Jan`)
  
**Solutions:**
- Used an apostrophe (`'1-5`)
- Pre-formatted cells as Text
- Used en dash: `1â€“5` (Alt + 0150)
